# JS-Examples

## What's in here? ## 
This repo contains sample snippets of JavaScript code. I made this repo so that I would have a place to put all of my references.

## Why does this exist? ## 
The references here contain things like how to use certain JavaScript objects to design patterns that I would like to remember.
